<p>Established on Canada’s beautiful West Coast in 2007, the Victoria Guitar Trio is one of today’s leading classical guitar ensembles. Described as “energetic and engaging,” audiences and reviewers have heralded the trio for their virtuosity and depth of interpretation. Their concert repertoire is diverse and includes original transcriptions of early music, Spanish and Latin-American guitar favorites, and new cutting-edge works. The Victoria Guitar Trio is committed to enriching the contemporary guitar repertoire and to promoting the music of Canadian composers, they have premiered many new works and will release their debut CD of all-original Canadian music for three guitars in 2017.</p>
